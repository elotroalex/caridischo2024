### The Data Sheet

Many colleagues, students and friends contributed to our data sheet. Here's credit where credit is due, in order of number of contributions by year:

#### 2020

**Roopika Risam**, with an award-winning 42 contributions---slow clap; **Alex Gil**, **Kaiama L. Glover**, **Amalia S. Levi** and **Schuyler Esprit** with several entries; **Kaneesha Parsard**, **Perry Collins**, **Tao Leigh Goffe** and **Stephanie Curci** with a couple of great entries; and, tapering off to the very much appreciated in-and-out, **Adrian Wisnicki**, **Ellen Fernandez-Sacco**, **Greg Pierrot**, **S. Max Edelson**, **Melissa Jerome**, **Nadine Zubair**, **Mary Borgo Ton**, **Winnie Pérez Martínez**, **Christina Boyles**, **Ariana Hernandez-Reguant**, **Joshua Ortiz Baco**, **Laura Wagner**, **Arturo Victoriano**, **Emilie Boone** and **Liberty Martin**.

Once the data was in, an enormous amount of labor fell on Soraya Limare to clean up the data, provide screenshots where there were none, and add missing data.

#### 2021

This year's cake is shared between **Kelly Baker Josephs** with 8 new entries, and **Alex Gil** with 9. Shout-outs to **Gaiutra Bahadur**, **Margarita Vargas-Betancourt**, **Hadassah St. Hubert** and **Katerina Gonzalez Seligmann** for their contributions. This year, Alex Gil added Spanish translations to the aggregate data.

#### 2024

**René Kooiker** wins this round by far. He was responsible for revising all pre-existing entries, checking links and adding new projects. **Alex Gil** did a forward migration of the site to Wax Facets from the original Wax site, and provided several new entries. Special shoutout to Elizabeth McAlister for adding "Espàs Milokan" to the directory.

### The Site

The site for the directory was built by Alex Gil using a curated and refined version of the data on our data sheet in 2020. In 2021, Alex added multilingual capacity to the site. In 2024, Alex added faceted browsing to the site.

The site architecture is built with [Wax Facets](https://minicomp.github.io/wax-facets/), built by [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex) and Angela Zoss. Wax Facets adds faceted browsing to the original Wax, a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led by [Marii Nyröp](http://marii.info/). Wax relies on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [Leaflet IIIF](https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/), and [IIIF_S3](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3), and builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex). Multilingual localization is made possible by [Polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot) by Samuel Volin.

### Partners

The directory was born as an idea for [The Caribbean Digital VII](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2020/) during times of widespread virtuality, rare virtue and surprising virtuosity. The conference was organized in 2020 by Kaima L. Glover, Kelly M. Josephs and Alex Gil. Their combined inspirations provided the seed ideas for the directory.

The first two rounds of the directory were supported by the Digital Humanities Center at Barnard and Columbia University Libraries. In 2024, the [Caribbean Digital Scholarship Collective](https://cdscollective.org/), generously sponsored by the Mellon foundation, provided welcome new support.
