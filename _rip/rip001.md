obit_en: ARC Magazine was a non-profit print and online publication and social platform
  launched in 2011, and lasted until 2018. The magazine sought to fill a certain void
  by offering a critical space for contemporary artists to present their work while
  fostering and developing critical dialogues and opportunities for crucial points
  of exchange, scholarship and study. The magazine was lovingly and tenaciosly stewarded
  by artist, curator, researcher, writer, spiritualist and Earth Ally, Holly Bynoe.
  We all benefited enormously from the run of the magazine. During the decade it was
  active, it was our main source of news about new work, often being the only place
  where we could find emerging digital artists. Thank you, Holly and all of the members
  of your wonderful team. The run of the journal can still be accessed on the Internet
  Archive. See link below.
