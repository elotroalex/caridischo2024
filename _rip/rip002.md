obit_en: 'Caribe Fractal was a virtual exhibit by Jos√© Arturo Ballester Panelli for
  the University of Michigan, RCAH LookOut Gallery, as part of his tenure as Artist-in-residence
  with Electric Marronage. The project was hosted online during COVID using the Matterport
  platform. The original blurb read, &quot;Works exploring nature as a force of destruction,
  dispersal, and renewal in the Caribbean''s ongoing dialogue with climate change
  and ties to diaspora.&quot;. As of 2024 the online exhibition is no longer available
  online. Because the platform was an embed from a bespoke platform, we cannot recover
  the project using the Internet Archive. You can still read about the project and
  the artist on the original link. '
