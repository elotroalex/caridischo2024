obit_en: Junkanoo in Grand Bahama was the work of students of The University of The
  Bahamas-North, in English Studies courses. The original project, designed by Sally
  Everson, set out to document Junkanoo in Grand Bahama, its history, practices, and
  its participants. Our student projects are often imagined as ephemeral. This might
  be rightly so. We still often mourn their loss, when we know their impulse was to
  fill a gap online. In this case, doubly so, since the Internet Archive version was
  not able to capture most of the content. We hope the students in who built this
  are doing great, and that they have carried the lessons from this course with them.
