obit_en: 'The remains of Nancy Prince: A Transamerican Archive show the beginnings
  of &quot;a multimedia exhibit around the life of Nancy Prince.&quot; This project
  was a baby Omeka project, abandoned in its infancy. The about page was never finished,
  so we know little about its creation. We don''t know what happened to it. Nancy
  Gardner Prince was an African-American woman who wrote about her travels in Russia
  and Jamaica during the nineteenth century in her autobiography <em>A Narrative of
  The Life And Travels of Mrs. Nancy Prince</em>, published in 1850. You can read
  more about Prince in Wikipedia and in the scholarly record.'
