  of the Puerto Rican experience in the United States and that produces and disseminates
  relevant interdisciplinary research. Centro also collects, preserves, and provides

obit_en: 'A Century Of Unheralded Service was created by the Center for Puerto Rican
  Studies at Hunter College (Centro) to &quot;unveil over a century of dedicated,
  but largely unrecognized service [of Puerto Ricans] in the U.S. armed forces&quot;.
  The last we saw of the project it was private access. The Internet Archive version
  tells us the project advanced a bit before we lost sight of it. We cannot find the
  original project in the Centro database anymore, nor on the internet. Sadly, some
  of the interactive features and some of the images are gone in the versions stored
  at the IA. That said, most of the project''s original materials live on, and in
  archival storage can serve the original goals of the project. '
