blurb_orig: Phantom Islands are artifacts of the age of maritime discovery and colonial
  expansion. During centuries of ocean exploration these islands were sighted, charted,
  described and even explored – but their existence has never been ultimately verified.
  Poised somewhere between cartographical fact and maritime fiction, they haunted
  seafarers’ maps for hundreds of years, inspiring legends, fantasies, and counterfactual
  histories. Phantom Islands – A Sonic Atlas interprets and presents these imaginations
  in the form of an interactive map which charts the sounds of a number of historical
  phantom islands.
