blurb_orig: Developed by historian Laurent Dubois, PhD candidate in English Mary Caton
  Lingold, and composer-scholar David Garner, Musical Passage uses a digital format
  to explore a unique artifact of early African diasporic music. The site is designed
  around two pages from eighteenth-century British naturalist and collector Hans Sloane’s
  A Voyage to the Islands (1707), which documents his time in Jamaica in the late
  1680s. The pages of Voyage that have been placed at the center of this site present
  notation of songs played at a &quot;festival.&quot; This material is precious and
  fascinating, representing the earliest notation we have of music produced by enslaved
  Africans in the Caribbean or North America. The performers whose music is represented
  and interpreted here were likely survivors of the Middle Passage who may have been
  playing music they had learned in their homelands. They may also have been in the
  process of creating entirely new performance traditions.

  Mary Caton Lingold, y el compositor-erúdito David Garner, &quot;Musical Passage&quot;
  (Pasaje musical) utiliza un formato digital para explorar un artefacto único de
  la música de la diáspora africana temprana. El sitio está diseñado alrededor de
  dos páginas de *A Voyage to the Islands* (Un Viaje a las islas, 1707) del naturalista
  y coleccionista británico del siglo XVIII, Hans Sloane, que documenta su tiempo
  en Jamaica a fines de 1680. Las páginas de viaje que se han colocado en el centro
  de este sitio, presenta notación de canciones interpretadas en un &quot;Festival&quot;.
  Este material es precioso y fascinante, y representa la notación más temprana que
  tenemos de música producida por africanos esclavizados en el Caribe o América del
  Norte. Los intérpretes cuya música está representada e interpretada aquí fueron
  probablemente sobrevivientes del Pasaje del Medio, y junto a ellos, música que habían
  aprendido en sus países de origen.
