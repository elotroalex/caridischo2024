blurb_orig: 'This site, produced by Duke’s Haiti Lab, is meant to serve as a guide
  and portal to online resources about Haiti, specifically historical materials relating
  to the country and writings by Haitian authors. It is geared towards providing maximum
  access to these resources to Haitian readers. It is a work in progress: there is
  sometimes a lag between uploading documents in English and translating the material
  into the other languages. We welcome your comments about the organization of the
  site, as well as suggestions for materials you would like to see digitized and made
  available online.'
