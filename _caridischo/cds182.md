blurb_orig: "&quot;I Am Taíno&quot; is a portrait series addressing paper genocide
  and the manipulation of Taíno identity. The Taíno are the indigenous peoples of
  the Spanish-speaking Caribbean who were believed to be extinct up until recently,
  partly because the racial category for being indigenous (&quot;indio&quot;) was
  removed from census reports in the early 1800s, and they were forced to identify
  as either white, black or mixed on forthcoming census reports. The Taíno refer to
  this process as &quot;paper genocide.&quot;"

blurb_es: "&quot;Soy taíno&quot; es una serie de retratos que aborda el genocidio
  documental, y la manipulación de la identidad Taína. El Taíno son los pueblos indígenas
  del Caribe de habla hispana que se creían extintos hasta hace poco, en parte porque
  la categoría racial de indígena (&quot;Indio&quot;) se eliminó de los informes del
  censo a principios del siglo XIX, y se vieron obligados a identificarse como blancos,
  negros o mezclas en los próximos informes del censo. Soy Taíno se refiere a este
  proceso como &quot;genocidio documental&quot;."
