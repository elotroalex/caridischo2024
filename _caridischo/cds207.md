blurb_orig: 'Using advanced technology and tools to document, share and explore surrounding
  waters, the Bermuda 100 Challenge aims to create a marine heritage science and engineering
  methodology combining data acquisition, curation, analysis and dissemination. In
  doing so, the project will also construct the foundations of an ecosystem to enable
  continuous innovation. The reefs surrounding Bermuda are home to well over 100 shipwrecks
  in relatively shallow waters. Many surrounded by mystery and myth (think Bermuda
  Triangle), these sites are integral to the cultural heritage of this Atlantic outpost.
  Over the centuries, shipwrecks have become naturalized components of the benthic
  ecology – located on the bottom of the ocean – and these unique biological communities
  function as time capsules for the study of natural systems. Their stories tell of
  human ambition and courage as well as misadventure and tragedy, and they offer marine
  scientists new worlds of discovery. '
