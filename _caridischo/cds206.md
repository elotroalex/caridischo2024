blurb_orig: 'IN THE SAME SEA is the first systematic investigation of the combined
  history of the Lesser Antilles from the 1650s to the 1850s. The project advances
  the hypothesis that the Lesser Antilles were decisively shaped by inter-island connections
  that transformed separate islands into a common world of slavery and freedom. Living
  in fragile societies of limited resources and marked by racial slavery, plantation
  production, and long-distance commerce, enslaved Africans, free people of color,
  and Europeans depended on and gained vital resources from crossing the short sea
  routes to their neighbors in English, French, Dutch, Spanish, Danish, and Swedish
  colonies.  The project consists of a team specializing in the historiographies,
  archives, and languages of the six colonial powers present in the Lesser Antilles.
  A collaborative research methodology and digital solutions to data collection and
  mapping, enable the project to generate crucial new knowledge of how inter-island
  connections shaped the Lesser Antilles.  '
