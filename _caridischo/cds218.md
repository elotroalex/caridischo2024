blurb_orig: My hope is that people interested in Rara will be able to use this website—students,
  musicians, artists, travelers, other researchers. My idea is that it will serve
  as a companion-piece to my book on Rara. I therefore do not include large sections
  of the book, but rather short sections, and then refer the viewer to sections of
  the book for further information. Here I can show you the photos, videos, and songs
  that could not be included in the book.
blurb_en: Students, musicians, artists, travelers, and other researchers interested

  as a companion-piece Jessica Hutchins book on Rara. Short sections of the book are

  book.
