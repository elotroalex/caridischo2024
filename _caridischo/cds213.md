blurb_orig: Visualizing the Data of the Eighteenth Century French Caribbean offers
  contemporary researchers the opportunity to use the same census records and historical
  maps commissioned by the French royal government to analyze the dynamic transformations
  that occurred in the Caribbean colonies in fine detail. It does so by providing
  these sources in formats suited to today’s digital and visual technologies. When
  complete, the database and website will offer scholars open access to eighteenth
  century census records of the French Caribbean in digital formats that can be used
  alone or with georeferenced historical maps and GIS software. Equally important,
  the project will provide scholarly tools that will help investigators better understand
  the ways these sources blurred the imaginary and the objective quantitatively and
  visually, but with real-life implications for those who lived and toiled in the
  colonies. Together these digital formats and analytical resources will allow scholars
  at all levels to assess, visualize, and critically analyze the demographic and economic
  changes that occurred in the eighteenth century French Caribbean and generate new
  understandings of this revolutionary era and region.
