## A Directory of Caribbean Digital Scholarship

Welcome. On this website you can browse or search an open-source bibliography of digital resources resulting from---and meant for---the study of the Caribbean. Here you will learn more about the contours of our Caribbean scholarly and cultural record online. The bulk of our entries were compiled during one of the out-of-synch events that defined [The Caribbean Digital VII](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2020/directory/) conference in 2020. We've added new entries since sourced from the community. Run as a census, this directory takes a snapshot of our digital scholarship record up to the end of {{site.year}}. This is our third census. To learn more about the project please consult our "[Frequently Asked Questions]({{'/faq/' | absolute_url}})," select "Browse" or "Search" on our navigation menu above, or simply begin exploring one item at a time by clicking on this [completely random link]({{'caridischo/cds1.html'| absolute_url}}).
